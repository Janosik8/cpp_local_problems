# C++ Problem Solutions Repository

Welcome to my repository where I dive into the world of problem-solving through the lens of C++! Here, you'll find my solutions to various coding challenges, primarily focusing on algorithmic problems similar to those found on platforms like LeetCode, AdventOfCode, and others. Whether you're here to explore different approaches to problem-solving or to review some C++ techniques, I hope you find these solutions both informative and inspiring.

## What's Inside

This repository is structured by problem domains and includes a mix of classic algorithmic challenges, data structure implementations, and solutions to specific problems I've found intriguing.

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Identify the Problem:** Start by searching for a specific problem on the site it originates from (e.g., LeetCode, AdventOfCode). This approach ensures you understand the problem's context, constraints, and objectives before diving into the solution.

2. **Attempt to Solve:** Give the problem a try on your own. Applying your knowledge and attempting to solve it independently is a great way to enhance your problem-solving skills.

3. **Review the Solution:** Once you've attempted the problem, or if you're stuck and need some guidance, look for the corresponding solution in this repository. Solutions are organized to make it easy to find the problem you're working on.
